    <h3>Pseudo Classes vs. Pseudo Elements</h3>
  <p>It's important to differentiate between Pseudo Classes and Pseudo Elements. Pseudo Classes are used to select and style elements based on a specific state or condition, such as :hover or :active. On the other hand, Pseudo Elements, represented by double colons (::), are used to style a specific part of an element, such as ::before or ::after which add content before or after an element.</p>
